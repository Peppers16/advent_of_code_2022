#  FC Data Team - Advent of Code 2022 Colab

# Intro
Welcome!

This repo is a space for the Fincrime Data team to commit your code (either finished or work-in-progress). Hopefully this will help us 
collaborate, share attempts, and just version control your workings!

Collaborate here or in Slack #tmp-fc-data-advent-of-code-2022 

There's no strict structure but as a starter I'm suggesting something like: 

```
├── puzzle-1
│   ├── person-a
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── puzzle-1.py
│   ├── person-b
│   │   ├── go.mod
│   │   ├── puzzle-1.go
│   ├── person-c-person-d
│   .
│   .
│   .
├── puzzle-2
│   .
│   .
│   .
```

You're welcome to work individually or combine forces as you see fit on a puzzle-by-puzzle basis. This group is 
non-competitive and you're encouraged to share solutions or try out new languages if you want to! 


Note: this repo is public so don't paste anything internal-only (for some reason).
